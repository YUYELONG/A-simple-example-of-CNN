# A-simple-example-of-CNN
CNN is often considered as the basic of deep learning, here we present a simple example of CNN as shown in the following network. The whole network contains the input layer, convolution and pooling stage, full connected layers and output layer. Using the train sets of Mnist, we can train this CNN model, kernels and coefficient matrices are supposed to be trained.
